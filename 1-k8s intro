what is k8s ?
why do we need k8s ?
how does it help ?
how does it work ?

can we run our entire application in one and only docker container ! === No.
if answer is 'yes' there is no need of k8s.
k8s comes into picture not for sigle container but 
it comes into picture when we want to speak with multi container.
multi means multiple in many ways.
multiple means , it could be..
  1)same application redundancy.
  2)application broken down into multiple parts and all parts speacking with eachother.
  1)we dont want single point of failure.
    this is due to some hard disk his gone bad in a website which has only one server.
    anything happens to server our application going to die.
    that is single point of failure.
    we can avoid single point of failure by using redundancy.
    if we have more than one server, same application hosted at 2 servers.
    even if one dies, we still have other server.
    even our entire application in one container, for high availability we need k8s.
    otherwise we need to execute docker run commands manually.
  2)application broken down into multuple self executing services(micro services)
    then docker and k8s right thing to be done.
    
k8s is container orchestration engine, supports any container either docker container
or rocket container technology. swarm is specific for docker containers.
